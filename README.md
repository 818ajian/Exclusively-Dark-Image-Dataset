# Exclusively Dark (ExDark) Image Dataset

Oct. 31, 2018 - accepted for publication in CVIU.

Released on May 29, 2018

## Description

In order to facilitate a new object detection and image enhancement research, we introduce the Exclusively Dark (ExDark) dataset [(CVIU2019)](http://cs-chan.com/doc/cviu.pdf). The Exclusively Dark (ExDARK) dataset is a collection of 7,363 low-light images from very low-light environments to twilight (i.e 10 different conditions) with 12 object classes (similar to PASCAL VOC) annotated on both image class level and local object bounding boxes.
